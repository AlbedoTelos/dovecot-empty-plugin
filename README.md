This is a plugin for the Dovecot IMAP server. It does nothing, it is
just to figure out how to write a very minimal plugin; how to compile,
install and make Dovecot load it.

(So far, no success, I think the plugin is correct, but Dovecot does
not load it. At least i don't think so, since I do not see any of the
debug messages that it is supposed to print.)
